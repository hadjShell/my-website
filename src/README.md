## About the Website

Welcome to my personal corner of the web👋.

This website is a living notebook — a place where I document my reflections on both the **programming world** and the **physical world**. It serves as a record of what I learn, what I struggle with, and what I find meaningful along the journey of becoming a better software engineer and a wiser person.

### What You’ll Find Here

- **Structured and detailed learning notes** across a wide range of topics in computer science.
- A practical and battle-tested **crackbook for LeetCode-style coding interviews**.
- Some technical **blogs**, some reflective, and some simply honest snapshots of where I am at a given moment.
- Notes and reflections from **books I read**, spanning technology, philosophy, productivity, and other areas that shape how I think and work.

### Why This Website Exists

This website exists as a form of **learning documentation**, **public thinking**, and a way of **giving back to the community**. Writing helps me slow down, sharpen ideas, and connect dots between code, systems, and life. If something here helps you learn, reflect, or see things differently, that is a welcome bonus.

Thanks for stopping by :heart:.

## About the Author

Hi, I’m **David Zhang**, also known as **hadjshell**.

I recently graduated from **King’s College London** with a Master’s degree in Advanced Computing. I’m broadly interested in technical topics, with a particular focus on **full-stack development** and **operating systems**. I enjoy understanding how systems work end to end — from low-level abstractions all the way to user-facing applications.

Outside of programming, I enjoy staying physically active and exploring the world. You’ll often find me at the gym or playing basketball, road cycling, swimming, or traveling whenever time allows.

::: tip My favourite quote

**_Mind and hand._**

:::

I believe good thinking and good building reinforce each other — in code, and in life🫡.
