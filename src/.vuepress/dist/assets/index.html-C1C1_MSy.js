I’m broadly interested in technical topics, with a particular focus on <strong>full-stack development</strong> and <strong>operating systems</strong>. I enjoy understanding how systems work end to end — from low-level abstractions all the way to user-facing applications.</p><p>Outside of programming, I enjoy staying physically active and exploring the world. You’ll often find me at the gym or playing basketball, road cycling, swimming, or traveling whenever time allows.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">My favourite quote</p><p><strong><em>Mind and hand.</em></strong></p></div><p>I believe good thinking and good building reinforce each other — in code, and in life🫡.</p><h2 id="support-this-site" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#support-this-site"><span>Support This Site</span></a></h2><p>If you’ve found something here helpful — a note that clarified a concept, a blog that resonated with you, or a perspective that saved you time — you’re welcome to support this site.
