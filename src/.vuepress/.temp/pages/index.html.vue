<p>Welcome to my personal corner of the web👋.</p>
<p>This website is a living notebook — a place where I document my reflections on both the <strong>programming world</strong> and the <strong>physical world</strong>. It serves as a record of what I learn, what I struggle with, and what I find meaningful along the journey of becoming a better software engineer and a wiser person.</p>
<h3 id="what-you-ll-find-here" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-you-ll-find-here"><span>What You’ll Find Here</span></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured and detailed learning notes</strong> across a wide range of topics in computer science.</li>
<li>A practical and battle-tested <strong>crackbook for LeetCode-style coding interviews</strong>.</li>
<li>Some technical <strong>blogs</strong>, some reflective, and some simply honest snapshots of where I am at a given moment.</li>
<li>Notes and reflections from <strong>books I read</strong>, spanning technology, philosophy, productivity, and other areas that shape how I think and work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-website-exists" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-this-website-exists"><span>Why This Website Exists</span></a></h3>
<p>This website exists as a form of <strong>learning documentation</strong>, <strong>public thinking</strong>, and a way of <strong>giving back to the community</strong>. Writing helps me slow down, sharpen ideas, and connect dots between code, systems, and life. If something here helps you learn, reflect, or see things differently, that is a welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by ❤️.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-author" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#about-the-author"><span>About the Author</span></a></h2>
<p>Hi, I’m <strong>David Zhang</strong>, also known as <strong>hadjshell</strong>.</p>
<p>I recently graduated from <strong>King’s College London</strong> with a Master’s degree in Advanced Computing. I’m broadly interested in technical topics, with a particular focus on <strong>full-stack development</strong> and <strong>operating systems</strong>. I enjoy understanding how systems work end to end — from low-level abstractions all the way to user-facing applications.</p>
<p>Outside of programming, I enjoy staying physically active and exploring the world. You’ll often find me at the gym or playing basketball, road cycling, swimming, or traveling whenever time allows.</p>

<p class="hint-container-title">My favourite quote</p>
<p><strong><em>Mind and hand.</em></strong></p>

<p>I believe good thinking and good building reinforce each other — in code, and in life🫡.</p>
