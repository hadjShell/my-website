My past learning goal was to get myself into the computer science field as well as build a solid theory foundation on which I can step and thrive in my future career. Therefore, most of the books that I read in this period can be categorised into so-called \\\"tool-books\\\" or \\\"textbooks\\\". Those books taught me how to util a tool - for example, how to code in Java - just like teaching a soldier how to use a sword. However, if you want to be a real sword master, it is definitely not enough to merely know how to spike your enemy with it. I believe, the threshold of being any kind of master in life is whether you encounter the moment when you start to shape and form your own philosophy into the object that you are interested in and passioned about. Hence, I am here, wrting down this reflecting doc, on the very first book in the new chapter of my learning journey: \\\"<em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>\\\".</p>\",\"autoDesc\":true}")
