However, DP optimises this process by <strong>avoiding redundant exploration of repeated subproblems</strong> in the decision tree. This simple optimization typically reduces time complexities <strong>from exponential to polynomial</strong>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Three core elements of DP</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>State transition equation:</strong> Defines how a problem is broken down into smaller subproblems and how the solution to a state is derived from the solutions of those subproblems.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Optimal substructure:</strong> The optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using <strong>the optimal solution to its subproblems</strong> instead of trying every possible way to solve the subproblems. To satisfy the optimal substructure, <strong>the subproblems must be independent of each other</strong>. For example, we can say that the maximum marks of an exam has optimal substructure because we can solve it by checking the maximum marks of each subject; however, assuming math mark is associated with english mark, i.e., those are not independent, then the problem doesn't have optimal substructure.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"hint-container tip\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"hint-container-title\\\">Tips</p>\\n<p>The problem can be derived into different combinations of subproblems, therefore an optimal solution can be selected by comparison of those different answers.</p>\\n</div>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Overlapping subproblems:</strong> Many subproblems are solved multiple times. DP addresses this by using <strong>memoization</strong> (top-down) or a <strong>tabulation</strong> (bottom-up) to store and reuse previously computed results, avoiding redundant computations.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\",\"copyright\":{\"author\":\"David Zhang aka Hadjshell\"},\"autoDesc\":true}")
