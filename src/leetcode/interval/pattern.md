## 🧠 Concept

- Intervals represent **a range of values** or **a duration of time** with a defined **start** and **end**

- Common problem domain

  - Time management (**a time sequence**, find available slot, merge intervals)

  - Project management (tasks may have **dependencies**, i.e. one task must be finished before another task)

- Possible states for two intervals

  - There is a **gap** between A and B

  - A **overlaps** B
  - A **overshadows** B
  - Reverse of B to A
