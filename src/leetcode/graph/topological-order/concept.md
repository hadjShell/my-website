## 🧠 Concept

::: important Problem Domain

Dependecy Problem. DFS path.

依赖问题，首先想到的就是把问题转化成「**有向图**」这种数据结构，只要图中存在环，那就说明存在循环依赖

:::

- **DAG** - Directed Acyclic Graph

- Definition
  - A topological order of a directed graph G = (V, E) is an ordering of its nodes as v1, v2, …, vn so that for every edge (vi , vj ) we have i < j
  - ![](/assets/image/leetcode/topological.png)
  - A **sink vertex** has no outgoing edges.
  - A **source vertex** has no incoming edges.

- Properties
  - If G is a **DAG**, then G has **a node with no entering edges (source vertex)**. (It can have multiple sink vertices.)
    > If a DAG is not connected, it can have multiple source vertices.
  - If G is a **DAG**, then **G has a topological ordering**.

## 🛠️ Algorithm

1. isAcyclic?

::: tip Algorithm

**`visited` + `onPath` DFS: `onPath` 看每个节点出发是否存在环，`visited` 剪枝加速**

:::

2. **把图结构后序遍历的结果进行反转，就是拓扑排序的结果** (可以和第一步同步进行)

> 不前序的原因是一开始进去遍历的点不一定是 source vertex.
